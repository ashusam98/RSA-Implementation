# RSA_project

This project attempts to implement the following functions(finally useful for RSA implementation) in python:-

(1)Modular Addition

(2)Modular Multiplication

(3)Modular Exponentiation

(4)Euler's Phi Function

(5)Modular Inverse

(6)Modular Division

(7)RSA Algorithm

The details of the implementation are explained in the report attached.
